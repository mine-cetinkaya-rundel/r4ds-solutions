The advantages of faceting is seeing each class of car separately, without any overplotting.\n    The disadvantage is not being able to compare the classes to each other as easily when they're in separate plots.\n    Additionally, color can be helpful for easily telling classes apart.\n    Using both can be helpful, but doesn't mitigate the issue of easy comparison across classes.\n    If we were interested in a specific class, e.g. compact cars, it would be useful to highlight that group only with an additional layer as shown in the last plot below.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # facet\n    ggplot(mpg) + \n      geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)\n    \n    # color\n    ggplot(mpg) + \n      geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))\n    \n    # both\n    ggplot(mpg) + \n      geom_point(\n        aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), \n        show.legend = FALSE) + \n      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)\n    \n    # highlighting\n    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n      geom_point(color = \"gray\") +\n      geom_point(\n        data = mpg |> filter(class == \"compact\"),\n        color = \"pink\"\n      )\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=576}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-2.png){width=576}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-3.png){width=576}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-4.png){width=576}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n5.  `nrow` controls the number panels and `ncol` controls the number of columns the panels should be arranged in.\n    `facet_grid()` does not have these arguments because the number of rows and columns are determined by the number of levels of the two categorical variables `facet_grid()` plots.\n    `dir` controls the whether the panels should be arranged horizontally or vertically.\n\n6.  The first plot makes it easier to compare engine size (`displ`) across cars with different drive trains because the axis that plots `displ` is shared across the panels.\n    What this says is that if the goal is to make comparisons based on a given variable, that variable should be placed on the shared axis.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    ggplot(mpg) + \n      geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n      facet_grid(drv ~ .)\n    \n    ggplot(mpg) + \n      geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n      facet_grid(. ~ drv)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=576}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png){width=576}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n7.
